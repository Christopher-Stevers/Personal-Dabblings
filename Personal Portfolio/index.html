            <section class="programming-skills">I enjoy building responsive websites using HTML and CSS and with a
                smattering of Javascript. I have recently adopted CSS Grid as my layout of choice. Right now my learning
                is mainly focused on building my Javascript knowledge. I am also becoming familiar with Git and Github,
                mostly through their Visual Studio Code integrations.</section>

            <section class="about-me"><p>Hi, I'm Chris Stevers, an aspiring front-end developer in Southwestern Ontario. Growing up on a farm, I've learned that you really have to focus on the work that you accomplsih, not the hours put in and I believe that's a useful insight in any career. I pride myself in being reliable and hardworking in any job I take on . . . from building houses, to building websites.
                </p><p>I began studying coding from the back-end side and had a tough time becoming enthused about it. When I discovered web development, though, I fell in love with it. As I continue to learn I hope to work my way towards greater backend knowlege.
                </p>
            <p>When I'm not coding, I'm probably farming, playing games, or studying an instrument.</p></section>
